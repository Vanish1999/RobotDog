# DogRobot
At present, the movement methods commonly used in robots in the market and research can be divided into two categories: wheeled robots and walking robots. Wheeled robots use tires or tracks to move
smoothly with rollers. Therefore, under the geographical background of complex ground conditions like
rugged environment and large drop, the movement of wheeled robots has limitations. The walking robot adopts
the method of bionics, which greatly improves the range, ability and degree of freedom of the robot's
movement by imitating the way of human bipedal movement or animal quadrupedal movement. The research
topic of this undergraduate dissertation is based on the research and discussion of the four-legged walking
mode in the walking robot. The program coding is carried out through Matlab, the modeling of the robot dog is
carried out by Solidwork, and the robot simulation platform is CoppeliaSim (V-REP) imitating the dog. We
will design the machine equipment of the concept of "intelligent robot dog", and simulate its four-legged
walking mode through simulation and program, including stability analysis and speed adjustment, so as to
achieve a preliminary discussion on the gait control of robot dog and research.
